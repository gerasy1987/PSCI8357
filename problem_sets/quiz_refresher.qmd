## Section 1: Multiple Choice

*Circle the correct answer.*

**Question 1.** The expectation  $\E [X]$ of a random variable $X$ is:

a. The value of $X$ that occurs most frequently.  
b. A weighted average of possible values of  $X$, weighted by their probabilities.  
c. The variance of  $X$.  
d. The square root of the variance of  $X$.

**Question 2.** Which of the following is **NOT** true about conditional expectation  $\E [X \given Y]$?

a. It is a random variable itself.  
b. $\E [X \given Y]$ can sometimes equal $\E [X]$.  
c. $\E [X \given Y]$ is always greater than  $\E [X]$.  
d. It provides the expected value of  $X$ given the value of  $Y$.

**Question 3.** The variance  $V(X)$ of a random variable is:

a. $\E [X^2] - (\E [X])^2$.  
b. $(\E [X])^2 - \E [X^2]$.  
c. $\E [X]\E [X]$.  
d. $\E [X^2] + \E [X]$.

**Question 4.** What does  $X \indep Y$ signify?

a.  $X$ and  $Y$ are uncorrelated.  
b.  $X$ and  $Y$ are independent.  
c.  $X$ and  $Y$ have the same mean.  
d.  $X$ and  $Y$ have the same variance.

**Question 5.** If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, which of the following is incorrect?

a. $\E [XY] = \E [X] \E [Y]$.
b. $\E [f(X)Y] = \E [f(X)] \E [Y]$ for any function $f(X)$.
c. $\E [X \given Y] = \E [X]$.
d. $\Cov [X, Y] \neq 0$.

## Section 2: Short Answers

*Answer briefly. Provide the necessary steps and formulas for your proofs.*

**Question 6.** Explain the difference between variance and covariance, and describe what a positive covariance indicates about the relationship between two random variables.

```

**Question 7.** Define the Law of Iterated Expectation and provide a brief example of its application.

```{=tex}
\framebox(\linewidth,150){}
```

**Question 8.** Explain the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and why it is fundamental for hypothesis testing.

```{=tex}
\framebox(\linewidth,150){}
```

**Question 9.** What is a $p$-value, and how do you interpret it in the context of a hypothesis test?

```{=tex}

```

**Question 10.** Consider the simple mean estimator for a population mean. Define the estimator $\bar{X}$ as the average of a sample of observations $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$, where each $X_i$ is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable with the population mean $\mu$. Show that $\bar{X}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$.

**Question 11.** A study analyzes the relationship between individuals' access to the internet and their participation in anti-government protest. Let $Y$ represent protest turnout (1 for protest, 0 for stay home), and $X$ represent internet access (1 for access, 0 for no access). The joint probability distribution is given below:

|  **$Y$ \\ $X$**                   |    **Access ($X = 1$)**   |   **No Access ($X = 0$)**  |
|-------------------------|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| **Protest ($Y = 1$)**    |          0.4              |          0.2               |
| **Stay home ($Y = 0$)** |          0.1              |          0.3               |

1. Find $\Prob (Y = 1 \given X = 1)$ and $\Prob (Y = 1 \given X = 0)$.

2. Are protest participation ($X$) and internet access ($Y$) independent? Justify mathematically.

**Question 12.** You are studying the relationship between voter turnout ($Y$), campaign intensity in the district ($Z$), and political engagement ($X$) across citizens eligible to vote. The following frequency table summarizes the data you collected:

| **Political Engagement ($X$)** | **Campaign Intensity ($Z$)** | **Voter Turnout ($Y$)** | **Frequency** |
|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------:|
| Low                                | Low                              | Yes                         | 10            |
| Low                                | Low                              | No                          | 20            |
| Low                                | High                             | Yes                         | 15            |
| Low                                | High                             | No                          | 5             |
| High                               | Low                              | Yes                         | 25            |
| High                               | Low                              | No                          | 10            |
| High                               | High                             | Yes                         | 20            |
| High                               | High                             | No                          | 10            |

1. Calculate the joint probabilities $\Prob (Y, Z \given X)$ for $X = \text{Low}$.

```

2. Is $Y$ independent of $Z$ given $X$? You can check this using definition of conditional independence. *(Hint. Remember that it is enough for the conditional independence to not hold for at least one level of $X$)*
