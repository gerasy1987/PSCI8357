## Course Overview

This course offers an up-to-date exploration of causal inference in quantitative social science research. We will study two main components of causal inference: (1) the analysis of causal identification and (2) statistical inference based on research design. Our focus will be on non-parametric causal identification methods, along with non-parametric and semi-parametric estimation techniques. Additionally, we will prioritize the principles of research design and robust estimation and inference using frequentist approaches.

## Prerequisites

There are two prerequisits for this class. First, students should have a firm grasp of probability theory, statistical inference, and linear models at the level of STAT I or an equivalent course (e.g. do you remember what the law of iterated expectations is? Or the significance of the equation $\beta = (X'X)^{-1}(X'Y)$. Second, students should have some background in writing scripts to implement statistical analyses in [R]{.proglang}. The course provides foundational methodological training to Political Science PhD students in their first or second year as part of their required sequence of courses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Requirements

### Homeworks (4 $\times$ 10 %)

You will receive homework about every two weeks. You will have to submit your completed assignment within a week; exact deadlines will be made clear on the assignment. You can work with others, but to receive credit, your homework must comply with the following guidelines:

-   You must turn in a PDF copy of your own homework by the stated deadline to both the professor and TA.
-   The assignment that you turn in must clearly reflect your own thinking. Sets of verbatim copies of homework will have credit reduced by half.
-   Homework assignments may be hand written or typed, but they must be clearly legible.
-   Estimates obtained in [R]{.proglang} must be formatted properly into tables or graphs resembling journal presentation styles. You should use a table formatting function (e.g., `kableExtra`, `apsrtable` or `stargazer` in [R]{.proglang}). Use a reasonable (2 or at most 3) number of digits after decimal points, report standard errors or confidence intervals along with coefficients, clarify what are the dependent variables in each table or figure, and explain in footnotes to your tables or figures what kinds of estimators or adjustments have been used. Print outs of raw screen output or commented logs will not receive any credit. However, you may include such output as an appendix so that the grader can troubleshoot.
-   Mathematical derivations should include all key steps with explanations for important techniques.

Homework will be graded for points as indicated on each assignment and count toward 50% of your grade.

### Replications (2 $\times$ 20 %)

The main goal of this course is to learn not just theoretical foundations but also to learn how to implement some of the techniques in practice. To this end you will be required to complete two re-analyses of existing studies: one RCT or experiment and one observational. Each of you will be expected to pick up a paper at least a month prior to the replication deadline and let professor and TA know which paper you picked. Importantly, make sure that the replication data is available for the paper (e.g. via Harvard Dataverse or OSF). If the data is not readily available in online repositories, you can try to contact the authors (or ask professor), but be mindful of deadlines.

Once you pick the paper you are expected to do two main things. First, replicate the main analyses reported in the paper using your own code, not the code provided by the authors in replication archive (!). Second, you are expected to expand the main analyses in the paper in at least one of the following ways:

1.  Check for robustness. This can for example focus on how much do things depend on the particular estimation model or measurement technique.
2.  Alternatively you can go more deeply into the logic of authors' theory. This might sometimes constructing new tests (based on the implications of authors theory/hypotheses).

For both parts you need to post an abbreviated replication plan on Piazza at least a week before the submission of the replication report.

Your final submission should include data files you used + replication write-up in reproducible R Markdown or Quarto Markdown file (i.e. so that professor and TA can re-run your analyses on their machines). The write-up should include the following:

-   Brief summary of the paper's theory/hypotheses
-   Brief description of the data, model and main results (you can use screenshots from the paper to reference main results)
-   Report on replication of main results (code, output, interpretation)
-   Report on analyses expansion(s) (code, output, interpretation)

### Final Exam (20 %)

A final exam will be scheduled during the final examination week (Week of April 21st). The final also serves the purpose of evaluating individual progress, which in turn allows me to provide individualized recommendations on where students should apply effort to strengthen their methodological foundations. If you are unable to work during the exam period, you must provide notice at least a week prior so that we can arrange an alternative time. The final will count toward 25% of your grade.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Grading and Deadlines

-   **40% Homeworks** (due roughly every other week)\
-   **40% Replications** (due February 27th and April 17th)\
-   **20% Take-Home Final Exam** (Week of April 21st)

Late work will not be accepted without documented proof of a family or medical emergency.

Problem sets and exam will have opportunities to earn extra credit, theoretically meaning you could score above 100%. All grades are curved without taking the extra credit results into consideration. The class follow the standard Vanderbilt grading system: A 94+ \| A- 90-93 \| B+ 87-89 \| B 84-86 \| B- 80-83 \| C+ 77-79 \| C 74-76 \| C- 70-73 \| D+ 67-69 \| D 64-66 \| D- 60-63 \| F \<60

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Software

You will have to work in [R]{.proglang} in this class. I encourage using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for your assignments. This is a great investment that will pay off in the long run in terms of productivity as well as reproducibility. Quarto Markdown runs easily through RStudio or VS Code (or even many of its wrappers like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or soon [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/)).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Class Policies

### Cell Phones, Laptops, Tablets, etc.

You are asked to silence your cell phone / tablet / smart watch before class begins.

### Academic Honor Code

Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the Vanderbilt University Academic Honesty policy, available at [www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/).

While collaboration is a key component of the social sciences, it is imperative that each student's work on assignments reflects their own efforts. Care must be taken to avoid plagiarism. Collaboration is allowed on problem sets, but strictly prohibited on final exams and replications.

Academic misconduct, which includes cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, altering graded examinations for additional credit, having another person take an examination, falsification of results, and facilitating academic dishonesty, as specified further in the university policy, is unacceptable and may result in penalties such as failure of the assignment or course, as well as disciplinary actions at the program or university level.

ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) are acknowledged as useful tools for social scientists and may be used as resources for completing assignments and for achieving a deeper understanding of course concepts. However, it is essential that students' assignments are not solely generated by these tools. All assignments must document the ChatGPT prompts and outputs utilized.

### Accommodations for Learning or Access Disabilities

This course is designed to be inclusive and respectful of students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are barriers that affect the learning environment or require specific arrangements (such as those related to building evacuations), students are encouraged to discuss these with the instructor as early as possible. The confidentiality of these discussions will be respected. Students should also contact the Vanderbilt Student Access office ( [www.vanderbilt.edu/student-access/](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student-access/) ) to learn about specific accommodations and ensure they are provided in a timely manner. Accommodations requests should be made within the first three weeks of the semester, except under unusual circumstances.

### Mental Health

Students may encounter stressors that impact both their academic performance and personal well-being. These can include academic pressures and challenges related to relationships, mental health, substance use, identities, or finances. If these challenges interfere with academic success, students should reach out to the instructor to explore potential solutions together. Vanderbilt offers the following resources:

-   University Counseling Center: Provides individual and group therapy, psychiatric services, and assessments. Urgent Care Counseling is available in person from 9 am - 4 pm, Monday through Friday, or by phone 24/7. For more information, call 615-322-2571, visit [vu.edu/scn](http://vu.edu/scn), or connect with Student Care Coordination (SCC) where most referrals to the UCC begin.

-   Center for Student Wellbeing: Aims to support personal and academic success. Contact by calling 615-322-0480 or emailing [healthydores\@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:healthydores@vanderbilt.edu).

-   Student Care Coordination: Assists students in accessing campus and community resources for academic and personal support. Call 615-343-9355 or visit [vu.edu/scn](http://vu.edu/scn).

-   Crisis Text Line: For free 24/7 support, text VANDY to 741741.

-   National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: Call or text 988 for confidential, round-the-clock support.

-   Vanderbilt Psychiatric Hospital: Offers 24/7 crisis assessment and admissions. Immediate help is available by calling 615-327-7000.

### Mandatory Reporting

Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race and national origin. If students or someone they know has been harassed or assaulted, they can call the Project Safe 24-hour crisis/support hotline at 615-322-7233. A list of resources can be found at Project Safe. The University’s Title IX Coordinator (615-322-4705) is another contact point, where appropriate resources and contacts for confidential support are available: [www.vanderbilt.edu/title-ix/](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/title-ix/)

As faculty members, professors have responsibilities to help create a safe learning environment on campus, regardless of identity or circumstances. Professors also have a mandatory reporting responsibility. It is the intention that students feel able to share information related to their life experiences in classroom discussions, written work, and one-on-one meetings. Faculty will seek to keep information shared as private as possible. However, as representatives of an institution that strives for safety for all people, professors are mandatory reporters. University faculty, many staff members, and some student leaders are required to report incidents of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and child abuse, as well as any suspected discrimination (regarding age, race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national or ethnic origin, sex/gender, sexual orientation, disability, genetic information, military status, familial status, or other protected categories under local, state, or federal law) to the University’s Title IX Coordinator (615-322-4705), as required by University policy and state and federal law. If an experience of interpersonal violence and/or child abuse is disclosed to faculty or classmates with mandatory reporting duties, whether in class discussion, through a course assignment, or in private communication, the disclosure will be kept as private as possible but may not remain confidential.

### Diversity Statement

Social science centers around creative thinking aimed at answering challenging questions. Such creativity flourishes through exposure to diverse perspectives that stem from varied experiences. Diversity in all its forms, including age, ability or disability, ethnicity, national origin, race, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, and family and marital status, is highly valued in this class. It is expected that all students will respect these differences and strive to understand how others' perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews may differ from their own.

### Religious Holidays

Observing religious holidays and cultural practices is an important part of reflecting diversity. As an instructor, the commitment is to provide equivalent educational opportunities to students of all belief systems. Students should review the course requirements at the beginning of the semester to identify any foreseeable conflicts with assignments, exams, or other required attendance. If possible, students are encouraged to contact the instructor within the first two weeks of the first class meeting to discuss and make fair and reasonable adjustments to the schedule and/or tasks.
