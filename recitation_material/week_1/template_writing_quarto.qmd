# Introduction {#sec-section_nam2}

This is a paragraph. If I want to cite something at the end of a sentence, it is quite simple [@callawayDifferenceinDifferencesMultipleTime2021]. If I only want to cite the year, because I noted the author in the sentence, I only make a small change [-@gibbonsBrokenFixedEffects2019]. Footnotes are a breeze as well.^[See, look how easy this is!] You even have another way to reference footnotes, like this.[^2] There are other things to note with Quarto, but these are the basics for writing a standard manuscript. Below, in [Section 2](#sec-section_name2) I will show how you implement LaTeX math environments. See the .qmd file for how to cross-reference, like the sentence above

[^2]: The other way of typing a footnote! 

# Writing Math {#sec-section_name2}

Below, I have a math equation that I wrote in LaTeX's math environment. It's super easy to implement into your quarto files, you just need the following:

![Example Equation](/example_equation.png)

Which, as you can see, turns into the following:[^3]

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Y_{i, t}(\infty) - Y_{i, t^{'}}(\infty)|G_{i} = g] = \mathbb{E}[Y_{i, t}(\infty) - Y_{i, t^{'}}(\infty)|G_{i} = g^{'}],
\end{equation}
```
[^3]: Note, it should say =tex within the curly brakets in the image.
