## What We Will Cover Today

1. What Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDDs) are
2. When you can use RDDs (and when you can't)
3. What you need to report on with an RDD in a paper
4. Implementing the rdrobust package in R

## What is a RD?

1. A causal inference method when the treatment "occurs" differentially at some cutoff
2. Specifically, there is some "running variable" that probabilistically or deterministically at the cutoff/threshold
3. Popular research designs for RDDs include contexts where assignment sharply (completely) changes at an arbitrary cutoff
    - Elections
    - Educational tests (National Merit Scholarship & PSAT)
    - Population thresholds for receiving additional FPM funds in Brazil

## Visualization of an RDD with a DAG

- Visualization of RDD DAG, consider educational testing

## Types of RDDs {.smaller}

1. Sharp RDD
    - Treatment is deterministically assigned at the cutoff by the forcing variable
    - Can recover the ATE
2. Fuzzy RDD
    - Treatment is probabilistically assigned at the cutoff by the forcing variable
    - Can recover the LATE
    - More relaxed than the above
3. Regression Kink Design
    - More relaxed assumptions than the two above
    - Less common in political science, relatively more common in economics research 

## Wait, what's a forcing variable?

1. Some variable X that drives treatment assignment
2. We're interested in comparing units that are close to some arbitrary cutoff, c, where the forcing variable drastically (completely) changes.

. . . 

3. X and c allow us to calculate $\tau_c = \mathbb{E}[Y_{1i} âˆ’ Y_{0i}| X_{i} = c]$ and recover a causal estimator of interest!

## How can we calculate the ATE with an RDD? {.smaller}

. . . 

- Which units (all of them? Some of them?) would you use in this analysis to causally measure the effect of treatment?

## How can we calculate the ATE with an RDD? {.smaller}

1. We use the units that are in the "local neighborhood" of the cutoff from the forcing variable. Why?

. . .

2. Assignment on either side of the threshold can be argued to be as-if random
    - An election won by a few votes could have been swung by a voter not voting because it was raining
    - If you were one question above/below an educational test threshold, that one question difference is probably due to chance, not ability

. . .

## Threats to RDD validity and Data necessities?

1. Continuity at cutoff (dn)
2. Treatment assignment rule is known in advance (threat)
3. Units are interested in adjusting treatment status (threat)
4. Units have time to adjust treatment status (threat)
5. Cutoff is endogenous to factors that independently cause potential outcomes to shift (threat)
6. There is nonrandom heaping along the running variable (threat)

## Some basics you need when you report on an RDD

1. Visualization (graphs)
2. Run local linear regression
3. Provide results for both lower-order and higher-order polynomial non-parametric kernels
4. Run and visualize with different windows around the cutoff
