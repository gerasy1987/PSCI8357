# Introductory Spiel

## What We Will Cover Today
1. A quick introduction to what IV regression is:
    - What is an instrument?
    - Assumptions needed to recover LATE
2. Implementing an instrumental variable regression in R with the AER package

## The Limits of Selection-on-observales:
1. Recall our previous lectures on selection-on-observables
2. What can we do when there is some unobserved variable X that confounds both treatment (D) and outcome (Y)?

```{r confounded_dag}
#| label: fig-confound_dag
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-pos: H
#| out.width: "80%"

knitr::include_graphics("unobserved_dag.png")
```

## Introducing Instrumental Variables

1. Under certain assumptions, we can still causally estimate observational data even when we are unable to use a selection-on-observables strategy!
2. One such approach is called an **instrumental variables** identification strategy

## (Brief) Overview of Necessities for IV

1. Some variable $Z_{i}$ (instrument) is correlated with $D_{i}$ (first stage assumption)
2. $Z_{i}$ is uncorrelated with $X_{i}$ and $\nu_{i}$ (independence assumption)
3. $Z_{i}$ **ONLY** influences $Y_{i}$ through $D_{i}$ (exclusion restriction assumption)

## Visualizing IVs in a DAG
```{r confounded_dag}
#| label: fig-standard_iv
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-pos: H
#| out.width: "80%"

knitr::include_graphics("standard_iv.png")
```

## Visualizing (Violated) IVs in a DAG

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="48%"}

::: {.column width="48%"}
![](iv_exclusion.png)

::::

## Going From DAG to Data

1. IV typically relies on a two-stage regression

. . . 

- Regress the first stage with Z on D to obtain $\hat{D}$
- Then regress $\hat{D}$ on Y
- You now have the local average treatment effect (The ATE among compliers)

. . . 

- This is a **VERY** rough overview, we will learn about IVs more formally in class
